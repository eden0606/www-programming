            <p class="content-text">this is just a blurb about athena, the greek goddess of wisdom. the theme of this site
                reflects her dark birth
                (for lack of better words). it is said that during her mother metis' pregancy her father zeus swallowed
                metis
                along with athena who was in his womb at the time. she was born later in zeus' head fully grown, adorning
                armor.
                quite tragic in my opinon. she didn't get to enjoy the pleasures of childhood and was birthed an adult (from
                my
                understanding). this, however, does align with the fact that she is the goddess of wisdom as she was born in
                zeus' head. 1+1=2, so it adds up.</p>
